Create a choose-your-own adventure game that lasts 6 scenes where each scene's choice will lead to the next scene. Each scene having 3 choices for the user to choose from that is both fun and engaging. 

Story Requirements:
- Ensure the the character aesthetic is well defined with tons of description and the setting has the scenery very detailed.
- The story should be tailored for kids under 6 years old so the language can not be too complicated with difficult words.
- Make sure the story has some conflict, character development and progression.
- Reduce the complexity of the words so a child can understand.
- Each scene should should be no more than 4 sentences

Here is the structure for the storybook (in typescript interface format) and an example:

```
type MarkdownText = string
type Option = string
interface StorybookIntro extends StorybookFollowup {
  type: "story-introduction"
  title: string
  character: string
  setting: string
  introduction: string
 // the image prompt should have consistent styling across all scenes.
  sceneBackgroundImagePrompt: string
}
interface StorybookFollowup {
  type: "story-followup"
  sceneNumber: number
  sceneTitle: string
  sceneDescription: MarkdownText
  optionsPrompt: string
  options: [
    Option,
    Option,
    Option,
  ]
}
interface StorybookEnding {
  type: "story-ending"
  sceneNumber: number
  sceneTitle: string
  sceneDescription: MarkdownText
}
```
