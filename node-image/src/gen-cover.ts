Title:
Remy's Great Honey Quest

Setting Design descriptions:
A mystical realm where the sky ripples with auroras, and a hidden celestial event known as the Starfall brings magical gems to the world below

Character Design descriptions:
A brave and inquisitive bear named Remy with a patchwork satchel, adorned with twinkling stars

Introduction descriptions: 
Remy is a bear known throughout the Whispering Glens for his compassionate heart and adventurous spirit. His lush, dense fur is as dark as the night sky, with a patch of white on his chest resembling a shooting star. With his trusty satchel that seems to twinkle with the light of constellations, Remy stumbles upon an ancient scroll that speaks of a rare phenomenonâ€”the Starfallâ€”which is about to happen tonight. The gem that falls from above is said to grant the heart's deepest wish to the one who finds it. As the edges of the horizon blush with the colors of dusk, Remy wonders where he should begin.
