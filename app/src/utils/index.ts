  Create a choose-your-own adventure game that lasts 6 scenes where each scene's choice will lead to the next scene. Each scene having 3 choices for the user to choose from that is both fun and engaging. 
  
  Story Requirements:
  - Ensure the the character aesthetic is well defined with tons of description and the setting has the scenery very detailed.
  - The story should be tailored for kids under 12 years old so the language can not be too complicated with difficult words.
  - Make sure the story has some conflict, character development and progression.
  - Reduce the complexity of the words so a child can understand.
  - Each scene should should be no more than 4 sentences

    introduction: string
  }
  interface StorybookFollowup {
    type: "story-followup"
    sceneNumber: number

  }
  interface StorybookEnding {
