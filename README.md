Stored forever on the blockchain when you mint but displayed on our dashboard. We use Sui's display feature to pull data in.

### Easy to mint
We sponsor the mint for our users so that they don't have to worry about funding their wallet and the minting experience is seemless. (Using Sui's sponsored transaction, for Avax we didn't implement this but we can with pay master)
